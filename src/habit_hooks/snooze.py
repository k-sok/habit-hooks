"""habit-snooze: drop issues whose ``key`` is in a checked-in index.

As a transformer it reads findings on stdin and passes through everything it
does not drop. ``--snooze`` / ``--prune`` / ``--list`` maintain the index; the
transform itself only reads it.

``--until-changed`` makes the index a ratchet instead of a permanent exemption
list: a snooze then holds only while the file it was recorded against is
unchanged since this branch left the project's base ref. It ships as its own
transformer (``snooze-until-changed``) so a project opts into that, and the
default ``snooze`` keeps dropping unconditionally, asking git nothing.
